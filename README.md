<h5>Cyber crime</h5>
Cyber crime refers to illegal activities carried out using computers, digital devices, or the internet. It can target individuals, organizations, or governments, and includes a wide range of malicious actions.
<h5>Cyber law</h5>
Cyber law (also known as Internet Law or IT Law) is the area of law that deals with the legal issues related to the use of the internet, digital communications, and information technology. It encompasses laws that govern cyber crimes, online transactions, digital contracts, data protection, and intellectual property rights in the digital domain.
<h3>Existing cyber Laws in Bangladesh</h3>
<h5>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act, 2006</h5><br>

- Bangladesh's first cyber law, addressing offenses like hacking, data breaches, and cyber terrorism.
- Section 57 was particularly controversial for penalizing online content "offensive," leading to concerns over freedom of expression.
<h5>Digital Security Act (DSA), 2018</h5><br>

- Enacted to replace the ICT Act, aiming to combat cybercrimes and regulate digital content.
- Criticized for vague provisions that allowed for arrests without warrants and suppression of dissent.
<h5>Cyber Security Act (CSA), 2023</h5><br>

- Introduced to replace the DSA, intending to address previous criticisms.
- However, many provisions from the DSA were retained, leading to continued concerns over freedom of speech and potential misuse against journalists and activists. 
<h5>Cyber Security Ordinance, 2025</h5><br>

- Approved by the interim government in May 2025 to reform cyber laws.
- Repealed nine controversial sections from the CSA, including those related to the liberation war and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
- Recognized internet access as a civil right.
- Banned online gambling.
- Criminalized cyber sexual harassment and offenses involving artificial intelligence.
- Cases filed under the repealed sections are to be automatically withdrawn

<h3> Difference between Bangladesh and other Country of the world</h3>

Bangladesh’s cyber law framework is still developing compared to top countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, India, and members of the European Union. The key legislations in Bangladesh are the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act, 2006 and the Digital Security Act (DSA), 2018. While these laws address cybercrimes such as hacking, identity theft, and cyberbullying, they have faced criticism—especially the DSA—for vague definitions and potential misuse to suppress freedom of expression. In contrast, countries like the US have mature and detailed laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), while the EU has robust data privacy protections through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Bangladesh currently lacks a dedicated data protection law, unlike India, which recently introduced the Digital Personal Data Protection Act. Furthermore, enforcement mechanisms in Bangladesh, such as the Cyber Tribunal and digital forensic units, are still evolving and face limitations in resources and expertise. Public awareness of digital rights and online safety is relatively low, and there is limited alignment with international cybersecurity standards. However, Bangladesh has made progress through initiatives like the BGD e-Gov CIRT and is reportedly drafting a data protection law. Overall, while Bangladesh has taken steps toward digital regulation, there is a strong need to enhance legal protections, balance enforcement with civil liberties, and align more closely with global best practices in cybersecurity and data privacy.
<h3>Reforms to Strengthen Bangladesh's Cyber Laws for a Secure Digital Future</h3>

- <h6>Enact a Comprehensive Data Protection Law</h6>Bangladesh must introduce a strong, dedicated data privacy law to regulate personal data usage, ensure user consent, and hold organizations accountable—similar to the EU’s.
- <h6>Reform the Digital Security Act (DSA)</h6>Amend vague and overbroad sections of the DSA to protect freedom of expression and prevent misuse against journalists, activists, and ordinary users.
- <h6>Strengthen Cybercrime Investigation and Enforcement</h6>Upgrade the capacity of law enforcement and the Cyber Tribunal with modern digital forensics tools, trained personnel, and faster legal procedures.
- <h6>Promote Public Awareness and Digital Literacy</h6>Launch nationwide programs to educate citizens on cyber safety, digital rights, and how to report online crimes, especially for youth and vulnerable groups.
- <h6>Align with International Cybersecurity Standards and Agreements</h6>Adopt global standards like ISO/IEC 27001, and join treaties such as the Budapest Convention to improve cooperation on cross-border cybercrime and digital governance.

These reforms are essential for ensuring security, freedom, and trust in Bangladesh's digital future.
