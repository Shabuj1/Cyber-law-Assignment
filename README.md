# Cyber crime
Cyber crime refers to illegal activities carried out using computers, digital devices, or the internet. It can target individuals, organizations, or governments, and includes a wide range of malicious actions.
# Cyber law
Cyber law (also known as Internet Law or IT Law) is the area of law that deals with the legal issues related to the use of the internet, digital communications, and information technology. It encompasses laws that govern cyber crimes, online transactions, digital contracts, data protection, and intellectual property rights in the digital domain.
# Existing cyber Law in Bangladesh
<h3>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act, 2006</h3><br>
*Bangladesh's first cyber law, addressing offenses like hacking, data breaches, and cyber terrorism.
*Section 57 was particularly controversial for penalizing online content  "offensive," leading to concerns over freedom of expression.
<h3>Digital Security Act (DSA), 2018</h3><br>
Enacted to replace the ICT Act, aiming to combat cybercrimes and regulate digital content.
Criticized for vague provisions that allowed for arrests without warrants and suppression of dissent.
<h3>Cyber Security Act (CSA), 2023</h3><br>
Introduced to replace the DSA, intending to address previous criticisms.
However, many provisions from the DSA were retained, leading to continued concerns over freedom of speech and potential misuse against journalists and activists. 
<h3>Cyber Security Ordinance, 2025</h3><br>
Approved by the interim government in May 2025 to reform cyber laws.
Repealed nine controversial sections from the CSA, including those related to the liberation war and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
Recognized internet access as a civil right.
Banned online gambling.
Criminalized cyber sexual harassment and offenses involving artificial intelligence.
Cases filed under the repealed sections are to be automatically withdrawn
